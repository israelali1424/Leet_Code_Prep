# Sliding Window Algorithm

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Used for finding subarrays in an array that satisfy given conditions.
- **Concept:**  
  Maintain a subset of items as your window and resize/move the window within the larger list until you find a solution.
- **Relation to Dynamic Programming:**  
  It is a subset of dynamic programming, as it solves a problem by dividing it into subproblems.
- **Interview Relevance:**  
  Frequently asked in technical interviews, especially in subarray/substring-related questions.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – Linear time  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – Constant space

## Identifying Sliding Window Problems
- Commonly used in problems involving:
  - Subarrays
  - Subsequences
  - Substrings

## Notes
- The sliding window technique optimizes brute-force solutions by reducing unnecessary iterations.
